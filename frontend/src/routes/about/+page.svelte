        I'm a recent Computer Science & Engineering graduate at the University of Nevada, Reno, and
        I enjoy building backend systems and developer tools. My goal is to work at a non-profit,
        either in environmental, healthcare, or transportation, working towards a more ethical and
        sustainable future.

        I completed this project apart of my Human-Computer Interface class, focusing on building a
        tool that I needed, while incorporating HCI design principles.
